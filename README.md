## Cake Test

## Overview

* The app must be unit tested
* Demonstrate use of core Angular constructs: Controllers, Directives (components for
bonus points!), Filters, Routing.
* Styling is not important, but layout is. Demonstrate simply how the app would lay out on
smaller tablet devices
* Demonstrate use of a build tool and a simple readme explaining how to run the project.
E.g
	* Grunt
	* Gulp
	* Webpack
	* Npm running shell scripts if you prefer it leaner!

* The imageUrl can just be a plain text field (no image picking or upload is required)
* Deliver the app in any way you like, via a github repository or even a zip file.
